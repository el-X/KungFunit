# KungFunit
KungFunit is an easy to use, customizable and mobile-friendly unit converter
with an open minded API. On top of that it is capable of running on Googles _App
Engine_.

The project itself consists of two modules: a
[client](https://github.com/el-X/kungfunit/tree/master/client) and a
[server](https://github.com/el-X/kungfunit/tree/master/server). Both of these modules can be found in their corresponding folders. There you
can read on on how to install and run the project as a whole.
